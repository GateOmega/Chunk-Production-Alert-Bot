## How to find your chat ID? (channel ID)
  
We need a chat id to be able to get alerts from our server. Every chat room has an ID number attached to it. It doesn’t matter if it’s private or public.   
- Firstly go to [Web Telegram](https://web.telegram.org). Open your channel. Look at the URL at the top of the screen.   
- You will see url like that : https://web.telegram.org/z/#-1567031322  
- The number after the # is actually your chat ID. 1567031322
